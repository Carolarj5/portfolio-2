      All my life I have lived in a tropical area having my house 15 minutes away from the ocean. I have always loved being on the beach and spending time around the sand, the sea, and the sun. The immensity of the ocean and what is still unexplored has always sparked interest in me. I imagined how life would be underwater, or perhaps what would happen if one day we ran out of resources and needed to look for other ways of survival. Would we accommodate to the underwater world? 
Based on these ideas, I created an image that represents how life would be underwater. I achieved this by mixing images, textures, and filters. Aside from creating an imaginary world I was able to use digital tools to make something new and exciting, refreshing on previous knowledge I had from Photoshop and do some research to use the latest tools and make my vision come alive. 
An important part of this was the introduction to using Visual Studio Code. This was an obstacle for me as I tend to take more time learning new programs. Changing the color, images, and text on the website through VSC to upload my work was a challenge but this taught me to look for help and solutions when facing any problem. I would like to learn more ways to use this program more efficiently and advance my knowledge of VSC.
